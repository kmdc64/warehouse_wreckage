# warehouse_wreckage
 A simple sandbox game made with Unreal Engine 5 where the player fires projectiles at barrels in a warehouse environment.

 I followed the "Unreal 5.0 C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games" course by GameDev.tv, but expanded upon the concepts they taught by doing my own self-research and introducing features such as HUD UI & a timer mechanic.
